# Vpc (Virtual Private Cloud)
        It acts as a security for our instances.VPCs provide network isolation and segmentation within the AWS Cloud. Each VPC is a logically isolated section of the cloud where we can define our own IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables. 

# (In simple words, a VPC is used to create a private, customizable, and controlled network environment in the AWS Cloud. It allows you to design and deploy your infrastructure with a high level of control, security, and flexibility.)

# Subnets:
         VPCs can be divided into subnets, each with its own CIDR block. Subnets are useful for organizing resources, implementing network security, and ensuring high availability by spreading resources across multiple Availability Zones.
# Security Groups:
             Purpose: VPCs allow you to use security groups and network access control lists to control inbound and outbound traffic at the instance and subnet level. This provides a robust network security layer for your resources.
# Ec2 Instance:
             Ec2 instance is an service provided by the aws. Ec2 is nothing but a virtual server by using this we can make our web application deploy into this server and make it run with adding the volume and keeping security and also we can distribute the traffic.
           
# S3 Bucket: 
           A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. You can store any number of objects in a bucket and can have up to 100 buckets in your account.
